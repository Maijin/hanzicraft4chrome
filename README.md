hanzicraft4chrome
=================

A quick chromium extension that just perform a request on [HanziCraft](hanzicraft.com) website in order to get a quick info on a chinese character such as decomposition in radical by just right-clicking on it.

I use it in addition to [Chineasy](http://chineasy.org/) which is just an awesome book
